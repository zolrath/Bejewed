I've never written anything that actually reads data off the screen or manipulates a different process so this was a fun
day of experimentation. Time to clean up the code and likely rework how I'm actually checking for the matches.

Needs to prioritize the special gems and go for matches longer than 3 gems long before resorting to 3 gem matches. Tired
of seeing it destroy 4-5 long chains in order to make 3 gem matches. Onward!

Also, none of these changes ever happened or will ever happen.
